The lipo adapter is designed to replace the battery holder
it holds an LDO, connector for an external charger and pads for the lipo

Since it is a very simple board, I designed it using the easyEDA online suite.
I recomend manufacturing it as thin as possiable.

For the LDO, I used TLV74333PDBVR, but a more efficiant model would be preferable
